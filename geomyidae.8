.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
is a daemon for serving the protocol specified in
.Em RFC 1436
(Gopher). Under 1000 lines of C by design, it is lightweight yet supports
dynamic content, automatic file/directory indexing, logging and privilege
separation.
. 
.Sh IMPLEMENTATION
Installation is straightforward: grab the zipped tar file, expand it in
an appropriate temp directory, change to the
.Qq "../geomyidae-x.xx"
directory, tweak the Makefile if desired (installs in
.Qq "/usr/bin"
by default), then run the 
.Sq "make ; make install"
commands.  The resulting executable should be run by root.
.
.Ss Installation example:
.Pp
.Bd -literal
     % wget http://www.r-36.net/src/geomyidae/geomyidae-current.tgz;
     % tar -xzvf geomyidae-*.tgz;
     % cd geomyidae-*;
     % make; sudo make install;
     % sudo mkdir -p /var/gopher;
     % sudo cp index.gph /var/gopher;
     % sudo eomyidae -l /var/log/geomyidae.log -b /var/gopher -p 70;
     % tail -f /var/log/geomyidae.log;
     #
     # Use whatever gopher client you like to gopher to
     # gopher://localhost
     #
     # Have fun!

.Ss Running
Geomyidae should normally be started by root.  Though, it can be started
by a regular user provided that the base directory and its contents are owned
by the same user.  Geomyidae will only serve content within the base directory
tree and will drop privileges to the
.Fl u Ar user
and
.Fl g Ar group
values if set.  See
.Ic OPTIONS
below for specifics.
.
.Sh OPTIONS
geomyidae options and default settings:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width ".Fl test Ao Ar string Ac"
.
.It Fl d
Don't fork into background.
.
.It Fl l Ar logfile
Specify the file where the log output will be written (default: no default).
.
.It Fl v Ar loglevel
Set the logging level (default: 15).
.
.Bd -literal
Loglevels:
        0 - no logging
        1 - served plain files
        2 - directory listings
        4 - HTTP redirects
        8 - errors (e.g., not found)
  e.g.:
        1 + 2 + 4 + 8 = 15
        (files + directories + HTTP + errors)
.Ed
.
.It Fl b Ar base 
Root directory to serve (default: /var/gopher)
.
.It Fl p Ar port
Port geomyidae should listen on (default: 70)
.
.It Fl o Ar sport
Port geomyidae displays within base directory (default: 70).
.
Use in conjunction with
.Ic -p
for obfuscating actual port neomyidae is running on.
.
.It Fl u Ar user
Sets the user to which privileges drop when geomyidae is ready
to accept network connections (default: user geomyidae runs as).
Helps improve security by reducing privileges during request
processing.
.
.It Fl g Ar group
Sets the group to which privileges drop when geomyidae is ready
to accept network connections (default: group geomyidae runs as).
Helps improve security by reducing privileges during request
processing.
.
.It Fl h Ar host
Host to use in directory listings (default: localhost)
.
.It Fl i Ar IP
IP to which geomyidae binds to (default: 127.0.0.1)
.El
.
.Sh FORMATTING
Structured Gopher space(s) can be created with geomyidae through the
use of special indexing files of the form
.Ic <name>.gph
which, if present, geomyidae uses to format and/or filter the contents of
the base directory (/var/gopher by default) and create gopher menus.
However, index files are
.Em not
required: if no .gph files are found geomyidae simply lists the directory
contents in alphanumeric order.  In addition, a directory can utilize
multiple index files to create a layered gopher environment without the
use of sub-directories: ie. pictures.gph, music.gph, documents.gph could
be "directories" within main.gph, yet all reside in /var/gopher along with
their respective files (*.jpg, *.mp3, *.pdf for example).
.
.Ss Anatomy of an index.gph file
In general, each line of an index.gph file has the following structure:
.Pp
.Bl -inset -offset indent
.It Ic [<type>|<desc>|<path>|<port>]
.El
.Pp
where,
.Bl -inset -offset indent
.It Ic <type>
= A valid gopher Item Type.
.Pp
Some common Gopher Types as defined in
.Em RFC 1436
:
.
.Bd -literal
 0   Item is a file
 1   Gopher directory
 3   Error
 7   Item is an Index-Search server.
 8   Item points to a text-based telnet session.
 9   Binary file. Client reads until TCP connection closes!
 g   GIF format graphics file.
 I   Indeterminate image file. Client decides how to display.
.Ed
.Pp
In addition, geomyidae provides these:
.Bd -literal
 h   Item is a hypertext (HTTP) link
 i   Informational Item (used for descriptive purposes)
.Ed
.
.Pp
Note: geomyidae doesn't require "informational" text to be formally
Typed as "[i|...]"; any line
.Em not
beginning with "[" is treated as informational, greatly simplifying the
formatting of index.gph files.
If a line begins with "t", this "t" is left out. This measurement is
there to allow lines "informational" text beginning with "[".
.
.It Ic <desc>
= description of gopher item. Most printable characters should work.
.
.It Ic <path>
= full path to gopher item (base value is / ).  Use the "Err" path for
items not intended to be served.
.
.It Ic <host>
= hostname or IP hosting the gopher item. Must be resolvable for the
intended clients.
.
.It Ic <port>
= TCP port number ( usually 70)
.
May be omitted if defaults are used.
.El
.
.Ss index.gph Example
A root.gph file for a server running on host=frog.bog, port=70.  Note use
of optional [i]nformational Item (line 2) for vertical space insertion:
.Pp
.Bd -literal -offset indent
Welcome to Frog.bog

.Sh USING DYNAMIC CONTENT 
Dynamic content can be generated under geomyidae by simply creating a file
in for form of
.Ic <name>.cgi
in a directory that is being served. Such files are run as a shell script.
(See below for description.)
.Pp
ex. dtail.cgi - prints daily log entries
.
.Bd -literal -offset indent
#!/bin/sh -e
echo "Logged activity for `date '+%A, %B %d, %Y'` :"
echo "==============================================="
LOG="/var/log/gopherd.log"
DATE=`date "+%a %b %d"`
/usr/bin/grep "$DATE" $LOG
exit 0
.Ed
.
.Pp
Geomyidae supports two variable queries.  The basic form is
.Pp
.D1 executable.cgi{argv[1]}?{argv[2]}
.Pp
where
.Pp
.D1 argv[1] = strings (everything before the '?' in the query)
.D1 argv[2] = arguments (everything behind the '?' in the query)
.Pp
A search query request must have an item Type of "7" to be called
from an index.gph file.  It may also need a "?" suffix in the <path>
field.
.
.Pp
ex. hello.cgi - say hello to user
.
.Bd -literal -offset indent
#!/bin/sh
NAME=$1
echo ""
echo Hello $NAME - welcome to Frog.bog
exit 0
.Ed
.
.Pp
Call the above with the following index.gph entry:
.Pp
.D1 [7|Hello You - Please enter your name|/hello.cgi?|frog.bog|70]
.
.Pp
And do a simple
.Xr snarf 1
query:
.Pp
.D1 % snarf Qo gopher://frog.bog/7/hello.cgi?Christoph Qc -
.D1 Hello Christoph - welcome to Frog.bog
.Dl %
.
.Sh LOG FILES
.Pp
The log file (/var/log/gopherd.log is default) has the following structure:
.
.Pp
.Ic [<date>|<IP:port>] <item path> <query> (<status>)
.
.Pp
where,
.
.Bl -inset
.It Ic <date>
= access date and time (std 'date' format)
.Bl -inset -offset indent
ex.
.Qq "Sun Feb 17 06:11:10 PST 2008"
.El
.It Ic <IP:port>
= client IP address and port served
.Bl -inset -offset indent
ex.
.Qq "24.208.18.127:16857"
.El
.Pp
.It Ic <item path>
= full path to item served
.Bl -inset -offset indent
ex.
.D1 Qo "/PICS/simple2.jpg" Qc for an image file
.D1 Qo "/PICS" Qc for a directory access
.El
.It Ic <query>
= query term submitted (Type 7 requests only)
.Bl -inset -offset indent
ex.
.Dl % snarf Qq "gopher://frog.bog/7/hello.cgi?Christoph"
.Dl would log Qo "Christoph" Qc as the query term.
.El
.It Ic (<status>)
= status of client request
.Bl -inset -offset indent
ex. - some common status entries:
.El
.Pp
.Bl -hang -width XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX -compact -offset XXXXXXXXXXXX
.It Qo (serving) Qc
=> a successful request
.It Qo (not found) Qc
=> an unsuccessful request
.It Qo (HTTP redirect) Qc
=> web link redirect (Type h)
.It Qo (dir listing) Qc
=> unindexed directory listing

.Sh HISTORY
Geomyidae started as a Linux/BSD port of the Plan 9 gopherd_P9 server.
Originally called gopherd_BSD, the name was later changed to Geomyidae
(latin), the taxonomic family of burrowing rodents known as "pocket
gophers" which are in fact the true gophers. Because of inconsitencies
and the UNIX culture, the name was changed to lowercase in 2010.

.
.Sh LICENSE
Geomyidae is released under the MIT/X Consortium License.
.
.Sh BUGS
Geomyidae occasionally aborts silently if too many simultaneous
requests are made.  Limiting gopher traffic via firewall rules
may help.
.Pp
Dynamic content functionality may vary across gopher clients.
